        <p>The creature falls down, dead. The whole village cheers your name!</p>
        <p>They throw you a feast, and give you your pick of any man or woman in the village for you to marry. They also deem the area where your sword landed into the tree as their new monument.</p>
        <p>As you're eating, one of the 300 Lords shows up behind you and whispers into your ear <strong>"YOU WIN!"</strong>.</p>

        <p>The force of the slice was so strong it wedged the sword into the ground, impossible to take out.</p>
        <p>The whole village cheers your name!</p>
        <p>They throw you a feast, and give you your pick of the men or women in the village to marry. They now worship the spot where your sword is stuck in the ground, forever remembering your name.</p>

        <p>You smell something cooking in the distance and follow the smell.</p>
        <p>At the end of the trail is a house. On top of the house there is a billboard that says "Momma's Kitchen". Hungry, you enter.
            Momma is standing there with a knife, as soon as she sees you she stabs you to death. She bakes you into a pie
            and serves you to her demon guests.
        </p>
        <p>One of the 300 Lords purchases your pie. They whisper loudly into your pie <strong>"YOU LOSE!"</strong>.</p>
